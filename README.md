# Battlesnake Naive, but kinda hungry

That's my first Battlesnake, I wrote the core of it in a few hours and
then decided to enroll it into the [Fall league
2021](https://play.battlesnake.com/arena/fall-league-2021/). Because
it performed better than I expected, I decided to develop it further,
however the principles stay the same:
* No AI (let's see how far I can get)
* Some focus on eating/growing

This is a work in progress, so the code might look pretty bad, however
it works.

# References

This code is based on the [Go Starter
Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-go). I
have already done a good deal of refactoring and at some point it will
have totally diverged from the original codebase.
